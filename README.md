# BIT-ResourceHub
BIT Resource Hub is a centralized academic platform built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to help students access study resources in a structured and intuitive way. The website provides a clear navigation path from Year → Semester → Subject → Modules, with each module containing options for Notes and PYQs (currently linked to sample Google Drive placeholders). Subjects are included up to Semester 5, while Semesters 6, 7, and 8 are marked as “Coming Soon.” The platform features a clean, card-based design with responsive layout and breadcrumb navigation for easy use. Future updates will include replacing placeholders with actual resource links and adding content for remaining semesters.
